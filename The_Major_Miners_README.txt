HOW TO RUN IT:
Download R for Windows here: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
You can use RStudio, a convenient IDE. Download here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
On UNIX, you can do Rscript rfile.R and it runs (executes) the R file. This works on OSX too.
You can also make R files executable in Windows as described here: https://www.r-bloggers.com/making-r-files-executable-under-windows/
